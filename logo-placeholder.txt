# Logo Placeholder

This is a placeholder file for your logo.

To add your logo to the International All Fours Live website:

1. Place your logo image file in the `public` folder
2. Name it `logo.png` (or `logo.jpg`, `logo.svg`, etc.)
3. The Logo component in `src/components/logo.tsx` will automatically use it

Supported image formats:
- PNG (recommended for best quality)
- JPG/JPEG
- SVG (for vector graphics)
- WebP

Recommended logo sizes:
- Header: 150x50 pixels
- Hero section: 300x300 pixels
- Footer: 120x40 pixels

The Logo component will automatically resize your logo to fit these dimensions while maintaining aspect ratio.
